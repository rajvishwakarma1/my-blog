Welcome to "My Digital Garden," an online space where I cultivate my thoughts and share the seeds of my coding journey with the world.

I always wanted to start a blog to keep track of my journey in coding. The triggering point was when I saw [Bhupesh's TIL](https://til.bhupesh.me/) & [Bhavani Ravi's Digital Garden](https://www.bhavaniravi.com/), which was exactly what I needed then. Blogging in chronological order didn't make sense anymore. With a wide array of topics to explore, the traditional landing page no longer sufficed. Consequently, I sought a solution that could utilize GitBook's well-designed pages and text to cater to my needs.

At first, I experimented with no-code tools due to their user-friendly interfaces, but being a coder myself, I soon realized that it didn't align with my preferences. As someone who enjoys coding, I wanted to harness my skills to create a website that truly represented my vision.

In the era of gazillion choices, each service boasts unique features, but they all demand constant attention. However, by structuring my blog without strict chronological limitations, I ensured that my content would thrive beyond the initial publishing date.

In an effort to utilize my time productively. This website, being my first TypeScript project, is a proof to my growth and dedication.

This place will be used to share not only my thoughts or my favorite books, but also my learnings and some code snippets I consider to be useful to others.

Welcome to my own little garden of knowledge!
I hope you find something interesting here, and if not then at least enjoy the beautiful weather outside.
