Hey there, coding comrades!

So i recently completed my first paid internship at a loyalty product based company. I was hired as a `Software Development Intern`. Nonetheless it was an exhilerating experience and i was able to learn about multiple things on how work is done in a software based company.

Embrace those breaks, lean on each other for support, and remember that our mental well-being matters just as much as our coding skills. We're in this together, and we've got this. ðŸš€
